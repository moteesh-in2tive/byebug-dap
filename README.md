# Byebug Debug Adapter Protocol

This gem adds [Debug Adapter
Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/debug-adapter-protocol) support to Byebug.

## TODO

- In STDIO mode, spawn with extra FDs and use those instead of 0/1?
- Many DAP features are already supported by Byebug and just need to be
  implemented in DAP mode
